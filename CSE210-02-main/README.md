## Code for Educational Purposes

- This program runs a game in which the player guesses whether they believe the next card on the deck will be higher or lower than the previous card they drew.
- Card_game.py holds the main program which runs the game
- Our team applied abstraction to our program by dividing up the card functions/data to various files:
- "card.py" (The main card class, which generates a number betweenn 1 and 13, and holds the instance for a card)
- "game_common.py" (All shared game data, variables, and information) 
- "card_game.py" (The main game class/file which executes the logic from "game_common.py" and "card.py" to create the card game.)
